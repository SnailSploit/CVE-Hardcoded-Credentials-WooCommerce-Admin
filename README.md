## Vulnerability Details

### How It Was Found

During a thorough code review of the WooCommerce Admin Plugin, a hardcoded credential was identified in the `index.js` file. The hardcoded string `wc-admin-free-features-tab-values` is used as a storage key. This was found while analyzing the code responsible for handling business details and features within the plugin. Hardcoded credentials pose a significant security risk as they can be easily discovered and exploited by attackers.

The specific code is as follows:

```javascript
export const PERSIST_FREE_FEATURES_DATA_STORAGE_KEY = 'wc-admin-free-features-tab-values';
